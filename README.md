# Chicken-Coop

This is our practice repository for Arduino code that we use for learning.  The typical use for our code is to 
control and monitor temperature in Al's chicken coop.  Beyond the learning aspect, we hope to add feed and watering algorithms to 
control mechanical feed and water "robotics".
